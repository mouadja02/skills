# Step 0: Pre-flight scan

Moved verbatim from SKILL.md so the entry file stays small. Step numbers refer to the design flow in SKILL.md.

### 0. Pre-flight scan

If the project already has code — a `package.json`, a `tailwind.config.*`, an `index.html`, any CSS — Hallmark should **read it before asking the user anything**. Stomping on an established palette or font stack is the difference between a skill the user keeps and a skill the user uninstalls.

**Six signal sources, scanned in order:**

0. **`design.md`** — at the project root (or `DESIGN.md`). If present, this is the **locked design system for the project** — written by a previous `hallmark redesign` run on the whole app, or by hand. **Read it first; it overrides everything else.** Subsequent picks (genre, theme, type, motion) defer to it. The diversification rule is *inverted* on `design.md`-managed projects: pages must share the system, not differ from each other. See [`verbs/redesign.md`](verbs/redesign.md) § Multi-page flow for how the file is produced and amended.
1. **Font stack** — `package.json` for `next/font`, `@fontsource/*`, `expo-google-fonts`, `geist`; any `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...fonts.googleapis.com/...">` in HTML / layout files; `tailwind.config.{js,ts}` `theme.extend.fontFamily`; `@import url("fonts.googleapis.com/...")` in any stylesheet.
2. **Palette** — OKLCH / HSL / hex values inside `:root` blocks; `tailwind.config` `theme.extend.colors`; any `tokens.json`, `design-tokens.{json,yaml}`, or DTCG-shaped file.
3. **Microinteraction stance** — `package.json` dependencies for `framer-motion`, `gsap`, `motion`, `lenis`, `lottie-react`, `@react-spring/*`, `auto-animate`. Any one of those = "motion-on" project. None = "motion-cut" project.
4. **Spacing scale** — Tailwind `theme.extend.spacing`; CSS `--space-*` custom-property pattern; presence of a 4-pt or 8-pt scale.
5. **Framework** — Next.js (`next` in deps), Astro (`astro`), Vue (`vue`), Svelte / SvelteKit (`svelte` / `@sveltejs/kit`), Remix (`@remix-run/*`), or vanilla HTML.

**Output format** — emit this block once, before Step 1, with file:line citations so the user can verify what you found:

```
Pre-flight findings:
· Font stack: Geist + Geist Mono (next/font, package.json L23)
· Palette: OKLCH custom properties (app/globals.css :root)
· Motion: framer-motion 11 installed (package.json L41)
· Spacing: Tailwind extend.spacing (4-pt scale, tailwind.config.ts L18)
· Framework: Next.js 15 (app router)

Hallmark will preserve: font stack, palette, spacing scale.
Hallmark will introduce: macrostructure, microinteraction discipline,
slop-test gates, hero enrichment recipe.

If you want Hallmark to override any preserved item, say so.
```

**Persistence.** Write the findings to `.hallmark/preflight.json` once. On subsequent runs, *re-use* the cached findings unless either:
- the user says "refresh pre-flight" (or "scan again", "re-scan"), or
- `package.json` / `tailwind.config.*` mtimes are newer than `preflight.json`.

If the cache is re-used, emit a one-line note instead of the full block: *"Pre-flight cached (last scan: 2026-04-30). Say 'refresh pre-flight' to re-scan."*

**Edge cases:**

- **`design.md` found** → emit *"`design.md` detected at project root — this is a system-managed project. Reading the locked design system; subsequent picks defer to it."* Then read the file in full and use it as the source of truth for genre / theme / typography / spacing / motion / CTA voice. Skip Step 1's catalog/custom dispatch; the system is already chosen. Proceed to macrostructure pick (Step 2) within the family `design.md` allows for this page's type.
- **No signals found** (vanilla HTML project, empty repo, scratch directory) → silent. One line only: *"No pre-flight signals — proceeding with full Hallmark stack."*
- **Conflicting signals** (e.g. `framer-motion` installed but no `motion.div` usage anywhere; or `Geist` import in `package.json` but `font-family: Inter` hard-coded in CSS) → flag the conflict explicitly: *"Conflict: Geist imported via next/font but a hard-coded `font-family: Inter` in app/globals.css L4. I'll preserve next/font Geist; please confirm or remove the Inter declaration."*
- **Empty project** (no `package.json`, no `index.html`) → silent.
- **The user said "ignore the existing project"** → skip pre-flight entirely; emit *"Pre-flight skipped at user request."* and proceed to Step 1.

**Two more sample outputs** for the model to imitate:

*Vanilla HTML project, motion-cut:*
> *Pre-flight findings: vanilla HTML, no framework detected. No motion library, no Tailwind, no design tokens. Hallmark will introduce: full token system, macrostructure, microinteraction discipline, slop-test gates. Nothing to preserve.*

*Astro + Tailwind + DTCG tokens already present:*
> *Pre-flight findings: Astro 5 (astro.config.mjs L1) · Tailwind v4 with @theme inline tokens (src/styles/global.css L3) · `tokens.json` at project root (DTCG format, 12 colour tokens, 6 font tokens). No motion library detected.*
> *Hallmark will preserve: Tailwind tokens, the `tokens.json` file (won't overwrite). Hallmark will introduce: macrostructure, microinteraction discipline, slop-test gates. Motion stance: motion-cut (no framer-motion / motion / gsap detected).*

The pre-flight block is the user's accountability line: *"here's what I noticed about your project before I touched anything."* Skipping it is the fastest way to lose the user's trust.
